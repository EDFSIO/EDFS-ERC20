# token-mix

A bare-bones implementation of the Ethereum [ERC-20 standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20), written in [Solidity](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity).

For [Vyper](https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper), check out [`vyper-token-mix`](https://github.com/brownie-mix/vyper-token-mix).

## Installation

1. [Install Brownie](https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html), if you haven't already.

2. Download the mix.

    ```bash
    brownie bake token
    ```

## Basic Use

This mix provides a [simple template](contracts/Token.sol) upon which you can build your own token, as well as unit tests providing 100% coverage for core ERC20 functionality.

To interact with a deployed contract in a local environment, start by opening the console:

```bash
brownie console
```

Next, deploy a test token:

```bash
brownie run [name script] [blockchain network] [account name]
```
please see how to [run script](https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/quickstart.html)

## Testing

To run the tests:

```bash
brownie test
```

The unit tests included in this mix are very generic and should work with any ERC20 compliant smart contract. To use them in your own project, all you must do is modify the deployment logic in the [`tests/conftest.py::token`](tests/conftest.py) fixture.

## Resources
